---PROJECT NOTES---
This is my first attempt at the Udacity Weather Journal project...

This app takes in two parameters; a zip code, and a journal entry. After clicking the "Write Entry" button, it generates a custom card that displays the following information; the current date, the weather in your current location, and the journal entry itself. This is made possible by utilizing Node.JS to dynamically .get() and .post() information, as well as uses the Fetch API (inside of the app.js file) to pull data from the OpenWeatherMap Web API. I also chose to take this project in a different visual direction from what the starter code offered.

---PERSONAL NOTES---
This project was full of firsts! I decided to try implementing Bootstrap for the first time, since my visual creativity is not the most extensive, and Bootstrap simplified that process for me. And as mentioned above, this is my first experience with Node.JS and Express.JS!

I had a decent understanding over server functionality/protocol prior to attempting this project, but had trouble with async-await functions; Udacity seemed to rush that section, so I had to do my own extensive research into the asynchronous javascript documentation. It definitely made this quite the learning experience!
